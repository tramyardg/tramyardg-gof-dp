## Composite

### When to use
- To have a hierarchical collection of primitive and composite entities.
- To create a structure in a way that the objects in the structure can be treated the same way.

### Intent
Composite objects into three structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets
clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
