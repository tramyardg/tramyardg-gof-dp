# Proxy Design Pattern
A proxy design pattern permits a proxy class to represent the original "subject" class. The real subject is usually contains sensitive information, or resource intensive to instantiate, therefore, a proxy is required to wrap the real subject class. This results to a more secure system, and less resource intensive.
